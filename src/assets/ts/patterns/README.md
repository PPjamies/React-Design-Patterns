### Factory

Encapsulates object creation in a separate class (create).

### Abstract Factory

More generic version of the Factory pattern.

### Builder

Provides flexibility in creating objects step by step (build).

### Chain of Commands

Decouples request handling by passing it along a chain of handlers (nextHandler).

### Observer

Publisher/subscriber like pattern used for event driven systems (update).

### PrototypeShallow

Creates new objects by copying existing ones (clone).
